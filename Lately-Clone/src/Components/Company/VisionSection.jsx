        Lately helps humans write better marketing content in collaboration with
        artificial intelligence and software automation. (That collaboration
        part is key, btw. And is the basis of everything we do.)

        Leading by example is core to our product and our belief. We walk the
        talk. And we do it, together.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={"1em"} fontSize="lg">
        Because Lately is a community. We see ourselves as an extension of our
        customers' marketing teams and we prioritize relatability and listening
        so they see us as not AI-powered software but as humans. We actively try
        to get to know each and every one of them and make ourselves available
        for them to get to know us.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={"1em"} fontSize="lg">
        Most importantly, we emphasize these beliefs internally, as well.
        Authenticity through honesty, collaboration, productive dialogue and a
        genuine desire to solve problems together is our lifeblood. As we are a
        community to our customers, we are also a community to ourselves; we
        recognize the magnitude of the journey we're on and rely upon each other
        to both acknowledge successes and work through challenges.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={"1em"} fontSize="lg">
        Together, in partnership with our customers, weâ€™re growing Lately into a
        new evolution of AI-content creation software that humans truly love.
